# Lab3 Synopsys Project - Cell-Based IC Design Flow

Notice that the `report.pdf` cannot be previewed on github since it is large. Please open it after downloading.

## Introduction

This lab covers the entire process from front-end design using Design Compiler, through the back-end processes using tools such as IC Compiler 2, StarRC, and PrimeTime, to verification using IC Validator and Formality. The lab includes several modules, each focused on different aspects of the design and validation process.
