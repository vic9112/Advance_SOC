# Lab3 Synopsys Project - Cell-Based IC Design Flow

## Introduction

This lab covers the entire process from front-end design using Design Compiler, through the back-end processes using tools such as IC Compiler 2, StarRC, and PrimeTime, to verification using IC Validator and Formality. The lab includes several modules, each focused on different aspects of the design and validation process.

## Table of Contents:
- Environment Settings: Setting up the EDA environment and libraries for your design.
- Lab Synthesis: Analyzing and synthesizing HDL code from RTL to gate-netlist.
- Lab1 Floorplan: Initiating design and creating a chip floorplan.
- Lab2 Placement & Route: Conducting macro and standard cell placement and routing.
- Lab StarRC: Extracting information on parasitic devices for simulation and analysis.
- Lab PrimeTime: Performing static timing analysis and power analysis.
- Lab4 Chip Finishing: Inserting filler and exporting the GDSII file for chip tape out.
- Lab IC Validator - DRC: Verifying the design rule check for the target technology.
- Lab IC Validator - LVS: Ensuring layout versus schematic matches the design.
- Lab Formality: Verifying the behavior of the circuit and layout.
